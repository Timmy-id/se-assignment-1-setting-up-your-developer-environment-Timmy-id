### Development Environment Setup
- The only programming language I had to setup was dart as I currently have other setups on my computer system.
- The process of setting up my dart environment is as follows:
    - I downloaded the dart sdk zip file.
    - I then unpacked the zip file and added it to path to allow for access on the command line.

- [Here](https://github.com/Timmy-id/IdeaFundr) is a link of a project I initialized with git

- I did not face any challenge when setting up my dart development environment as it was straight forward and easy to install.
